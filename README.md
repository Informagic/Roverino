Roverino
========

A "fork" of the DFRobotShop Rover that combines the XBee with the Adventure configuration in the 2.0 version of the rover.


1) Acknowledgements
Since I couldn't do a proper fork, I'd like to mention here that much of the code is taken from what has been published by RobotShop.eu, as well as OddBot's treatise on the Mr. General robot (manufactured by Dagu).

2) Hardware
What I did was buying the XBee kit and then adding the "missing" hardware items to complete the Adventure configuration, plus the Expansion Plate. You'll probably need much longer spacers, though. I replaced the 35mm Nylon spacers with 60mm steel spacers that I bought from ELV.
